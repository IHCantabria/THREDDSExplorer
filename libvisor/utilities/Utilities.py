    """This method is designed to concatenate an urlB which may be
    either relative to a 'middle' element of urlA, relative to the urlA
    final element, or a complete URL in an "intelligent" way.

    Will check, section by section of the URL (elements separated by '/')
    if the URL's have matching elements. If they do, a new URL will be
    returned which (hopefully) properly manages any "subfolder" which is
    repeated between both url's. Otherwise, it'll will only concatenate
    both.
    As an example, take the urlA: http://www.google.es/things/yourthings/
    and the urlB:                 yourthings/thing1.html.
    If we perform a direct concatenation, we would end up with an (in our
    example) invalid URL:
        http://www.google.es/things/yourthings/yourthings/thing1.html.

    If we perform a check by element, we will be able to eliminate the
    redundant elements informed in both URL's and construct the correct
    one. This is useful in environments in which you can not be sure if
    a given URL is relative to other, is relative but contains part
    of other, or is a full URL itself.

    As another joy, if you have two urls...
        http://www.url.com/elements/stored/thing1.xml
    and you pass it a whatever url...
        /stored/thing2.xml...
    this method will return...
        http://www.url.com/elements/stored/thing2.xml

    discarding any potential not interesting parts of the url. Including
    any file referenced at the end of the urlA (any thing.ext stuff).

    Use with care. A lot of.

    :param contentBetween: If you wish to insert another element
                            between both URL's (other than a slash)
                            put it here.
