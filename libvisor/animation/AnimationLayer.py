class AnimationLayer(object):
    """
    Main object interpreted by the Animator module.

    This object holds all the required information for that module
    to generate an animation from it. In the case of WMS/WCS layers
    in THREDDS Explorer, if no animationData and no animationGroup
    is defined (=None) the animator component will attempt to download
    it as defined through it's parsers (defined in .providersmanagers
    package).

    If, instead, those two attributes are assigned, the animator will
    not do any download action assuming the AnimationLayer object
    is complete and requires no further intervention.

    The reasoning for this is that we can, this way, generate full
    fledged AnimationLayer objects which hold a component we want
    to include in our animation without any post-processing in a
    final Animator object, just interpreting it, from any other controller
    which can generate this type of object.

    A practical example of this is TESEO Spill Simulator. A call to its
    controller will generate an AnimationLayer object, which can later
    be injected into THREDDS Explorer Animator module to be animated
    along other layers from other providers.
