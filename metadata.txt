about=THREDDS Explorer is a QGIS-based plug-in designed to make it easy for users to access georeferenced data accessible through any THREDDS based server. Data catalogues and maps are exposed to the user through a simple user interface, which allows him to choose any map or explore through all the server contents without resorting to exploring the default web based THREDDS interface. This plug-in should work with most THREDDS servers, and will be able to retrieve any layer provided through WMS, WMS-T and/or WCS services published by the server.
